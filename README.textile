h3. Ignis is an RIA(Rich Internet Application) for multi-user persistent-forever chatting.

Why is this cool? Simple. If you're on a project that needs a lot of knowledge sharing, it's easy to build up a base of information by just talking about it, and having it searchable.

h3. Credit

This application was inspired by Campfire which is a product of 37signals.

Unfortunately, I was unable to use a public service when behind a firewall for a particular company. So I decided to build my own persisting group-chat app. It is an ongoing effort.

h3. Installing

You must have Ruby 1.9.2 installed. All needed gems come bundled.

Check out the code from github, and then run the following commands:

<pre>
<code>
  bundle install
  rake db:migrate
  thin start
</code>
</pre>

That's it!

h3. Features

* Web based multi-room chat application.
* All conversations are logged and to the database.
* Automatically receive the last days worth of content in any room you enter.
* Active user notification when they aren't in a room that receives the message.
* When joining a room you automatically get a days worth of history.
* Alterable username so you can always pick a username that suits you.
* Messages are fully encoded, so you can post code or anything else you want in them.

h3. Features "in the pipeline"

h5. Short term:

* Pulling History for rooms.
* Link messages to their original writers.
* Adding a guest account for instant login.
* Search through chat history.

h5. Mid term:

* Move all authentication to real ExtJS components.

h5. Long term:

* Adding permissions for users... unsure of what form this will take, yet.
* At some point, if I get a chance, I would like to pull in proper SASS theming for ExtJS.

h3. Technologies used

Being the person I am, I built on top of other great technologies. Such as...

* Ruby on Rails (including such gems as: haml, sass, coffeescript, devise, redcloth and more...)
* ExtJS4 (an amazing rich UI framework produced by Sencha)

I presently use SQLite for my production database, but I have not strayed from active record. So you should be able to put any database you like behind it, assuming you have knowledge of how Ruby on Rails works.

h3. License

This software is licensed under GPLv3 (only due to it being required by ExtJS4's usage- Sorry! Not a fan of forcing licenses myself).
