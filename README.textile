h2. Ignis

A rich-interface web-based multi-user persistent chat application.

h4. Credit

This application was inspired by Campfire which is a product of 37signals.

Unfortunately, I was unable to use a public service when behind a firewall for a particular company. So I decided to build my own persisting group-chat app. It is an ongoing effort.

h4. Features

* Web based multi-room chat application
* All conversations are logged and to the database
* Automatically receive the last days worth of content in any room you enter
* Active user notification when they aren't in a room that receives the message

h4. Technologies used

Being the person I am, I built on top of other great technologies. Such as...

* Ruby on Rails (including such gems as: haml, sass, devise, redcloth and more...)
* ExtJS4 (an amazing rich UI framework produced by Sencha)

I presently use SQLite for my production database, but I have not strayed from active record. So you should be able to put any database you like behind it, assuming you have knowledge of how Ruby on Rails works.

h4. License

This software is licensed under GPLv3 (only due to it being required by ExtJS4's usage- Sorry! Not a fan of forcing licenses myself).
